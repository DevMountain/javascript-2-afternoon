/*Create an empty Object called backPack. Now, create a variable called 'item'
and set it equal to the string 'firstPocket'. Using bracket notation,
add a 'firstPocket' key (or property) to backPack, using 'item'.
Set the value of that key to 'chapstick'.

Using dot notation, add another key (or property) to your backPack object
that is named color, with the value being the color of your backpack. */
